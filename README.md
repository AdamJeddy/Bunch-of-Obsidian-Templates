# Bunch of Obsidian Templates - Still in development

***Bunch of Obsidian templates for a lot of things***

## What is Obsidian?

The human brain is non-linear: we jump from idea to idea, all the time. Your second brain should work the same.

In Obsidian, making and following connections is frictionless. Tend to your notes like a gardener; at the end of the day, sit back and marvel at your own knowledge graph.

## Project Description

The project is a collection of <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> templates I made and found (and altered).

All the available templates are not designed to be perfect, they are intended to be used as a reference for any user to build on them or to take ideas when building you're own templates.

## Usage

This is not a vault template, this is simply a folder of templates to be added in your vault.

You can add the templates to your vault in different ways, these are some of my easiest examples.

1. Download the repository, extract the files and add to your vault.
2. Go to a specific template and copy the text (Make sure you open in raw mode) and copy the text to a file in your vault.
